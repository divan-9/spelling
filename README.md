Create a single-page flashcard learning app in TypeScript that works like Anki and can be hosted on GitHub Pages as a single HTML file (no build system, just inline TypeScript compiled to JavaScript).

### Requirements:

*   **Week Selection:** A menu to select the week (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, etc.).
*   **Word Data:** Hardcode a list of words. Each entry should include:
    *   English word
    *   English definition
    *   Russian translation
    *   Pronunciation text (to be read aloud with the Web Speech API)
    *   A sample sentence in English.
*   **Flashcard Behavior:**
    *   The front of the card should show the definition in English.
    *   A button to play the pronunciation of the word (spelling test style).
    *   The pronunciation should play automatically when the card is shown.
    *   An input field for the user to type their guess of the English word.
    *   On submit, the card should flip and show the difference between the correct word and the userâ€™s answer (highlighting incorrect/missing letters).
    *   The back of the card should show the difference, the Russian translation of the word, and the sample usage sentence.
*   **Navigation:** Navigation controls for next card, previous card, and flipping the card.
*   **Design:** A minimal and clean design with CSS inside the same HTML file.
*   **Offline:** The app should work fully offline as a standalone HTML page.
*   **Technology:** Use only vanilla TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (no frameworks).
